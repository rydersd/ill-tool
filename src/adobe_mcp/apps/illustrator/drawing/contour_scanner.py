"""Axis-guided contour scanner for extracting vector paths from reference images.

Given a reference image and an axis (center + angle), this module:
1. Walks along the main axis in incremental steps
2. At each step, scans perpendicular (cross-axis) for color transitions
3. Collects edge transition points (background->feature and feature->background)
4. Separates into left_edges and right_edges contour lists
5. Fits efficient bezier paths through each edge set via curve_fit
6. Returns contour data ready for AI path placement

Tier 1 (top): Pure Python scanning, edge detection, and path fitting.
Tier 2 (bottom): MCP tool registration for scan_feature and place_contour actions.
